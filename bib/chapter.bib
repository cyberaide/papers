		  utility, has the potential to transform a large part of the
		  IT industry, making software even more attractive as a
		  service and shaping the way IT hardware is designed and
		  purchased. Developers with innovative ideas for new
		  Internet services no longer require the large capital
		  outlays in hardware to deploy their service or the human
		  expense to operate it. They need not be concerned about
		  over-provisioning for a service whose popularity does not
		  meet their predictions, thus wasting costly resources, or
		  under-provisioning for one that becomes wildly popular,
		  thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover,
		  companies with large batch-oriented tasks can get results
		  as quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1000
		  servers for one hour costs no more than using one server
		  for 1000 hours. This elasticity of resources, without
		  paying a premium for large scale, is unprecedented in the
		  history of IT.},
