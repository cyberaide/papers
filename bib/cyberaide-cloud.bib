  abstract = {Cloud Computing, the long-held dream of computing as a utility, has
	the potential to transform a large part of the IT industry, making
	software even more attractive as a service and shaping the way IT
	hardware is designed and purchased. Developers with innovative ideas
	for new Internet services no longer require the large capital outlays
	in hardware to deploy their service or the human expense to operate
	it. They need not be concerned about over-provisioning for a service
	whose popularity does not meet their predictions, thus wasting costly
	resources, or under-provisioning for one that becomes wildly popular,
	thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover, companies
	with large batch-oriented tasks can get results as quickly as their
	programs can scale, since using 1000 servers for one hour costs no
	more than using one server for 1000 hours. This elasticity of resources,
	without paying a premium for large scale, is unprecedented in the
	history of IT.},
