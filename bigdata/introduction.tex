\section{Introduction}

FutureGrid \cite{las2010gce,las12fg-bookchapter} ``is a project led by Indiana University and funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to develop a highperformance grid test bed that will allow scientists to collaboratively develop and test innovative approaches to parallel, grid, and cloud computing. FutureGrid will provide the infrastructure to researchers that allows them to perform their own computational experiments using distributed systems. The goal is to make it easier for scientists to conduct such experiments in a transparent manner.  FutureGrid users will be able to deploy their own hardware and software configurations on a public/private cloud, and run their experiments. They will be able to save their configurations and execute their experiments using the provided tools. The FutureGrid test bed is composed of a highspeed network connecting distributed clusters of high performance computers. FutureGrid employs virtualization technology that will allow the test bed to support a wide range of operating systems.''
