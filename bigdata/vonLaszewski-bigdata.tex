\begin{abstract}

In this chapter we will be introducing you to FutureGrid that provides a testbed to conduct research for Cloud, Grid, and High Performance Computing. Although FutureGrid has only a relatively small number of compute cores (about 4500 regular cores and 14000 GPU cores) it provides an ideal playground to test out various frameworks that may be useful for users to consider as part of their big data analysis pipelines. 

The chapter is structured as follows. First we will provide the reader with an introduction to Future Grid. We will list a number of projects that use Futuregrid to conduct data analysis and introduce some of them to the reader. We will tell you about which services and Hardware exists. Next we will analyze which services are preinstalled and are available for big data analysis. As services that users may need for their work we point out how such a testbed can be utilized not only while provisioning virtual machines, but also on bare metal. 

We conclude the chapter with our observation cast throught three years of operating FutureGrid and provide an outlook for the next steps.

\section{Introduction}

FutureGrid \cite{las2010gce,las12fg-bookchapter}“is a project led by Indiana University and funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to develop a highperformance grid test bed that will allow scientists to collaboratively develop and test innovative approaches to parallel, grid, and cloud computing. FutureGrid will provide the infrastructure to researchers that allows them to perform their own computational experiments using distributed systems. The goal is to make it easier for scientists to conduct such experiments in a transparent manner.  FutureGrid users will be able to deploy their own hardware and software configurations on a public/private cloud, and run their experiments. They will be able to save their configurations and execute their experiments using the provided tools. The FutureGrid test bed is composed of a highspeed network connecting distributed clusters of high performance computers. FutureGrid employs virtualization technology that will allow the test bed to support a wide range of operating systems.”


\section{Overview of FutureGrid for Big Data}

\subsection{Service Overview}

According to the manual FutureGrid provides a number of different services. These services include:
OpenStack which includes a collection of open source components to deliver public and private clouds. These components currently include OpenStack Compute) OpenStack Object Storage, and OpenStack Image Service. OpenStack has received considerable momentum due to its openness and the support of companies. 
Nimbus which is an opensource service package that allows users to run virtual machines on FutureGrid hardware. Just as in Openstack users can upload their own virtual machine images or customize existing once. Nimbusnext to Eucalyptus is one of the earlier frameworks that make managing virtual machines easier.
Eucalyptus is an opensource software platform that implements IaaS-style cloud computing. Eucalyptus provides an Amazon Web Services (AWS) compliant EC2-based web service interface for interacting with the Cloud service.  Eucalyptus has been previously the dominant alternative to AWS  in academia. However, based on usage patterns in FutureGrid we believe it is replaced by OpenStack.
High Performance Computing can be defined as the application of supercomputing techniques to solve computational problems that are too large for standard computers or would take too much time. This is one of the more important features that the scientific community needs to achieve their projects. Naturally using HPC resouces and services is also useful in the area of Big Data. Sometimes big data needs big machines. Thus, using HPC may be an ovious choice.
Map Reduce …. TBD …
Storage on FutureGrid has moderate size storage capability that will satisfy the users demand to compare and test someof the previously outlined services.
Information Services gather the information of the different elements that make up FutureGrid to provide accurate and complete knowledge of the computational environment. This information is presented using different web portals.
